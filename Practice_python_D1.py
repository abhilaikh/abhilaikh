''' Given the participants score sheet for your University Sports Day, 
you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given n scores. 
Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up. '''


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = map(int, input().split())
    
    arr1= set(arr)
    arr2= sorted(arr1)

Steps Used in solving the problem -

Step 1: First n will take an integer type input of n scores.

Step 2: then, arr will make a list of these n scores.

Step 3: After this, we converted our list to set so, it will not store multiple same integers.

Step 4: then, I sorted my list of scores.

Step 5: In the last step I printed the second-last integer of my list. And, it is the runner-up score.
